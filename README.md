🚀 Sentiment AI is a machine learning model designed to analyze customer reviews and extract sentiment insights. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Supervised Learning, this project classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, helping businesses understand customer feedback effectively.

🔥 Features:
✅ Sentiment Classification – Categorizes text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
✅ ML-Powered Insights – Uses NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF.
✅ Model Training – Implements Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks for classification.
✅ Data Visualization – Graphs and word clouds to showcase sentiment trends.
✅ Real-World Use Cases – Analyze product reviews, social media comments, and feedback data.

⚙ Tech Stack:
🔹 Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
🔹 NLP Libraries – NLTK, SpaCy
🔹 Data Processing – Pandas, NumPy
🔹 Visualization – Matplotlib, Seaborn
